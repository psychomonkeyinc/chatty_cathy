# TODO: Make chatty_cathy a Functioning, Packageable Product
# Focus: Medium training runs on romance, fashion, beauty, girly themes

## Project Structure & Packaging
- [ ] Create proper directory structure:
  - /src for source code
  - /data for training datasets
  - /models for saved weights
  - /scripts for utility scripts
  - /docs for documentation
- [ ] Add setup.py or equivalent for Mojo packaging (if available)
- [ ] Create requirements.txt equivalent listing dependencies:
  - Mojo version requirements
  - Any Python/Mojo libraries needed
  - Data sources (Goodreads, Gutenberg, etc.)
- [ ] Add MANIFEST.in for package data inclusion
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- [ ] Add .gitignore for model files, temp data, etc.

## Code Functionality & Optimization
- [ ] Ensure all imports are correct and modules load properly
- [ ] Optimize training loop for medium-scale runs (10k-100k tokens)
- [ ] Add checkpointing to save/restore training progress
- [ ] Implement proper validation and testing functions
- [ ] Add hyperparameter configuration files
- [ ] Ensure memory efficiency for medium training
- [ ] Add progress bars and logging for training runs

## Data & Content Focus
- [ ] Curate romance novel datasets focused on fashion/beauty
- [ ] Add data preprocessing scripts for romance content
- [ ] Create prompt templates for fashion/beauty/romance generation
- [ ] Add data validation to ensure quality content
- [ ] Implement data augmentation for variety

## User Experience & Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md:
  - Installation instructions (Mojo setup, WSL for Windows)
  - Quick start guide
  - Training commands
  - Generation examples
  - Troubleshooting
- [ ] Add example scripts for common use cases
- [ ] Create configuration templates for different training scenarios
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for medium training runs
- [ ] Document model capabilities and limitations

## Distribution & Deployment
- [ ] Create release packaging (zip/tar with all necessary files)
- [ ] Add installation scripts for different platforms
- [ ] Create web interface or API for easy interaction
- [ ] Add model export/import functionality
- [ ] Test deployment on clean environments
- [ ] Add licensing information

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for training pipeline
- [ ] Test generation quality on fashion/beauty prompts
- [ ] Validate emotional cognition integration
- [ ] Performance testing for medium training runs
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add fine-tuning capabilities
- [ ] Implement model versioning
- [ ] Add evaluation metrics dashboard
- [ ] Create community contribution guidelines
- [ ] Plan for larger-scale training support
